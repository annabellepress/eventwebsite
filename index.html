		<p>Ramen was traditionally a Chinese dish that migrated to Japan during the 19th century. Traditionally referred to as "shina soba" which roughly translates to "noodle dish," it was made on food carts and sold to the poor and working classes as a cheap meal. It was only until the 1950s that the name "ramen" was adopted. After several recreations and growing popularity, its status shifted to a popular gourmet meal that was a go-to destinations for visitors. While still broad and without complete certainty, it can be said that ramen was initally a Chinese meal that became refined and popularized in Japan.</p>
